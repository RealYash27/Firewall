# Firewall Using iptables for Network Security

This project aims to build a firewall on Kali Linux using iptables to enhance network security. The firewall setup is designed to control incoming traffic, allowing only specific services and IPs while blocking others. It also includes a logging mechanism to track dropped packets and provides a method to save configurations for persistence after reboot.
